# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## Introduction

This repository provides an overview of Requirement Analysis in software development, focusing on the process of gathering, documenting, and validating stakeholders' needs. It highlights best practices, tools, and methodologies to ensure the software meets user expectations and business objectives. The goal is to help developers and project teams establish a strong foundation for successful projects.

## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is a vital phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), where developers, project managers, and stakeholders work collaboratively to identify, document, and manage the needs and expectations of the system's users and the business. This phase serves as the foundation for the entire software development process by ensuring that all requirements are clearly understood and agreed upon before any design or development work begins.

This phase is to fully understand what the system should do, why it's needed, and how it will be used. By thoroughly analyzing requirements, the project team can identify potential risks and address them early in the development cycle, thereby reducing the chances of costly errors and scope creep later on.

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Requirement Analysis plays a crucial role in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). It ensures that the final software product aligns with business goals, user expectations, and technical constraints. Here are three key reasons why it is critical:

### 1. Prevents Miscommunication and Errors
By clearly defining what the system should do, Requirement Analysis ensures that all stakeholders and the development team have a shared understanding. This reduces the chances of misunderstandings, missing features, or rework later in the project.

### 2. Improves Planning and Estimation
Accurate and well-documented requirements help in estimating the time, cost, and resources needed for the project. This supports better project scheduling and budgeting, which are essential for successful delivery.

### 3. Reduces Scope Creep
Requirement Analysis sets clear boundaries for the project. It helps manage expectations and avoids the risk of unplanned changes or additional features being introduced without proper review, which can derail timelines and increase costs.

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

Requirement Analysis involves several structured activities to ensure that software requirements are accurate, complete, and clearly understood. Below are the five key activities involved:

- **Requirement Gathering**  
  Collect high-level needs and expectations from stakeholders through interviews, surveys, questionnaires, or brainstorming sessions. This step focuses on understanding what the users and business want from the system.

- **Requirement Elicitation**  
  Go deeper into the gathered information to clarify and refine requirements. Techniques such as use cases, user stories, prototyping, and observation are often used to uncover detailed and sometimes hidden needs.

- **Requirement Documentation**  
  Organize and record the requirements in a clear and structured format such as Software Requirements Specifications (SRS), user stories, or requirement lists. This documentation serves as a reference for developers, testers, and stakeholders.

- **Requirement Analysis and Modeling**  
  Analyze the collected requirements to identify conflicts, overlaps, priorities, and dependencies. Visual models like data flow diagrams (DFDs), UML diagrams, or process flows may be created to better understand and communicate the system.

- **Requirement Validation**  
  Ensure the documented requirements accurately represent stakeholder needs and are feasible within project constraints such as budget, timeline, and technology. This step often involves stakeholder reviews, walk-throughs, and sign-offs.

  ## Types of Requirements

In software development, requirements are generally categorized into two main types: **Functional Requirements** and **Non-functional Requirements**. Understanding both is essential for building a system that not only works as expected but also performs well and meets quality standards.

### Functional Requirements

Functional requirements describe **what the system should do** — the specific behavior, functions, and features of the application.

**Examples for a Booking Management System:**

- Users can create, view, update, and cancel bookings.
- The system must allow administrators to manage available rooms, dates, and pricing.
- Customers must receive booking confirmation via email.
- The system should support user login and authentication using a username and password.
- Users should be able to search for bookings based on date, room type, or customer name.

### Non-functional Requirements

Non-functional requirements define **how the system performs** certain tasks. They focus on qualities such as performance, usability, security, and scalability.

**Examples for a Booking Management System:**

- The system must respond to user actions within 2 seconds.
- Booking data must be encrypted during storage and transmission.
- The platform should support up to 10,000 concurrent users without performance degradation.
- The system should maintain 99.9% uptime availability.
- All user interfaces must be accessible according to WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards.

## Use Case Diagrams

Use Case Diagrams are a visual representation of how users interact with a system to achieve a specific goal. They describe the system's functionality from the user's perspective, highlighting the relationships between actors (external entities like users or other systems) and use cases (the actions or processes that the system performs).

### Benefits of Use Case Diagrams

1. **Simplified Communication**: They help convey the behavior of a system in a simple and understandable way, making it easier to communicate system requirements to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
2. **Identifying System Requirements**: Use case diagrams help identify and organize the functional requirements of the system by focusing on what users want to achieve.
3. **System Boundaries**: They help define the boundaries of the system by showing what is included in the system and what is outside of it.
4. **Clear Documentation**: Use case diagrams serve as a clear and structured form of documentation, which is essential for project management and system design.

Below is a Use Case Diagram that represents the actors and use cases of a typical booking system.

## Acceptance Criteria

Acceptance Criteria are specific conditions that a system or feature must meet to be considered complete and functioning as expected. They define the boundaries of a user story or feature and help ensure that the system meets both the functional and non-functional requirements set by stakeholders.

In the context of Requirement Analysis, Acceptance Criteria are essential because they provide a clear and agreed-upon definition of "done." They guide the development process, ensuring that the product meets user needs and quality standards. These criteria help in validating the system’s functionality and serve as the foundation for testing.

### Importance of Acceptance Criteria

1. **Clear Expectations**: Acceptance criteria provide a clear, shared understanding of what is expected from a feature or system. They define what is considered a successful implementation, reducing ambiguity.
2. **Scope Definition**: By setting the conditions that must be met, acceptance criteria help define the scope of a feature, making it easier to manage scope creep during the development process.
3. **Facilitating Testing**: Acceptance criteria act as the basis for creating test cases and for validating whether a feature meets its requirements. Without them, testing would be unfocused and inconsistent.
4. **Effective Communication**: They ensure that all stakeholders (including developers, testers, and product owners) are aligned on what needs to be delivered.
5. **Reduced Risk of Rework**: With clearly defined acceptance criteria, there is a reduced chance of misunderstandings and the need for rework once development is completed.

### Example of Acceptance Criteria for the Checkout Feature

1. **Successful Booking Confirmation**
   - Given that the user has selected a booking, when they proceed to checkout, then they should see a confirmation screen with their booking details (date, time, service, price).
   
2. **Payment Process**
   - Given that the user is on the checkout page, when they input valid payment details, then the payment should be processed successfully.
   - If the payment is successful, the user should receive an on-screen confirmation and an email with the booking details and payment receipt.

3. **Payment Failure Handling**
   - Given that the user is on the checkout page, when they input invalid payment details, then the system should display an error message explaining the failure (e.g., "Invalid credit card number").
   - The user should be given the option to re-enter payment details.

4. **Total Price Calculation**
   - Given that the user is proceeding to checkout, when they review their booking summary, then the total price should be correctly calculated, including taxes and any applicable discounts or fees.

5. **Booking Cancellation Option**
   - Given that the user has completed the payment, when they view their booking confirmation, then they should have the option to cancel the booking within a specified time window (e.g., within 24 hours).

6. **Security and Data Protection**
   - Given that the user inputs their payment details, when they submit the form, then the payment information should be securely processed using HTTPS and PCI DSS-compliant encryption standards.

These criteria help guide development and testing, ensuring that the feature is complete and meets user expectations.
